## Hi, my name is Brian!

A little bit about myself: I am a current sophomore attending [Taipei American School](https://www.tas.edu.tw/) in Taipei, Taiwan. I love spending my time outdoors engaging in a variety of sports, including swimming, cycling, and running. When I'm at home, I enjoy learning about and analyzing the stock market.

This is my personal blog detailing my thoughts on the business word. I often publish blog posts sharing everything I learn about the stock market with the purpose of educating others about it.
