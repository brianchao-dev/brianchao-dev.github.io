## What are Electric Vehicles?

 An EV, short for electric vehicle, is a "fully electric vehicle that runs on a rechargeable battery powering an electric motor". Unlike your typical gasoline fueled cars, EV's do not require exhaust pipes, gears, or the use of natural gases. EV's are also an extremely quiet ride without any sound except those noise generated from wind resistance and tires. There are generally two types of EV's: all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. As with its name, all-electric vehicles are fully powered by electricity, while plug-in hybrids rely on the use of petroleum in addition to electricity.
