## What are Electric Vehicles?

An EV, short for electric vehicle, is a "fully electric vehicle that runs on a rechargeable battery powering an electric motor". Unlike your typical gasoline fueled cars, EV's do not require exhaust pipes, gears, or the use of natural gases. EV's are also an extremely quiet ride without any sound except those noise generated from wind resistance and tires. There are generally two types of EV's: all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. As with its name, all-electric vehicles are fully powered by electricity, while plug-in hybrids rely on the use of petroleum in addition to electricity.

## Charging an Electric Vehicle

It is typical for EV owners to install chargers in their homes. With a simple plug at the end of the day, your EV will be fully charged by the next morning, saving yourself a burdensome trip to the gas station. There are also numerous public charging stations available at your convenience. However, charging an EV at a station may take noticeably longer than refueling a typical gasoline-powered car. The duration depends on the type of charger and the car. Rapid chargers are the fastest and can fuel between "60-200 miles of range in 20-30 mins." As a result, using an EV for long distance traveling will unfortunately require long stops at charging stations as opposed to quick gas station trips that take an average of 4.5 minutes. But, keep in mind that technology is improving fast! Ultra-fast EV chargers, which are capable of charging up to an incredible 150 kW, are already being developed. EV's also have much larger battery capacities as compared to 5 years ago. Furthermore, charging stations are being built rapidly with Tesla, itself, having over 1,826 stations. And a total of 41,400 charging stations in the U.S. with many more to come.

## The Greener Option

In my opinion, **EV's are the solution to climate change**. Cars are one of the major causes of global warming due to its emission of greenhouse gases, most notably, carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere causing our planet to increase in temperature. The United States alone produced 6,558 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2019. Of the emissions, 29% can be attributed to transportation, which mostly includes cars. It has become common to hear people referring to public transportation as a solution to decrease global warming. Although true, public transportation is only available in cities as with metro stations.  As you move further from the cities, it is harder for people to travel with public transportation. There are fewer buses and no subways, leaving cars as the only option. That explains why there are 276 million cars in the United States as of 2019. Cars are thus unavoidable making it difficult to decrease pollution. By turning towards electric vehicles, however, the entire world can significantly decrease the amount of greenhouse emissions while retaining our beloved vehicle. EV's produce far fewer emissions than gas-fueled vehicles. Unfortunately, the downside is that the process of mining lithium, which is used to make electric batteries, is extremely harmful to our environment. 

According to UNCTAD, these environmental damages can be solved "by investing more in sustainable mining techniques and technologies that can recycle more effectively the raw materials found in spent lithium-ion batteries."

There are 1.42 billion cars worldwide. Imagine the environmental impact if all these cars turned electric. So, are electric cars the solution?

## Electric Car Companies

In recent years, a number of notable car companies have been coming out with electric cars. Take for example, Porsche, who released its first fully electric vehicle called Taycan, and General Motors, an original American car company. However, these companies are "not usually considered as electric car companies because their primary products aren’t electric" according to the Motley Fool. So what counts as an electric car company? The answer: companies that focus purley on producing electric cars. The electric vehicle industry can also include companies that manufacture electric car batteries or autonomous vehicle systems. The leading EV company is Tesla. With a 582.93 B Market Capitalization as of 6/3/2021, Tesla is the largest car company globally with a promising future. In China, three electric car companies have emerged: Nio, XPeng, and Li Auto. All three of these startups are very new, but are definitely leaders in the electric vehicle industry. Also, in the United States, is Lucid Motors, which is publicly traded under the name CCIV. Lucid Motors focuses on creating the Mercedes Benz of electric cars with its emphasis on luxury. A rather less known company is Fisker. The CEO of Fisker, Henrik Fisker, used to work at Tesla as a car designer before starting his own company. The Ocean is Fisker’s all-electric SUV, which will be coming out in 2022.
